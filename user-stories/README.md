# Airbnb Clone Backend - User Stories

## Overview
This directory contains user stories for the Airbnb Clone backend project. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.

## User Stories Structure
Each user story follows the format:
- **As a** [type of user]
- **I want** [some goal]
- **So that** [some reason]

This format helps ensure we understand who we're building for, what they need, and why they need it.

## Purpose
These user stories serve as:
- Requirements documentation for developers
- Prioritization guide for product management
- Communication tool between stakeholders
- Foundation for test case development

The stories cover core functionalities identified in the use case diagram and feature documentation.
